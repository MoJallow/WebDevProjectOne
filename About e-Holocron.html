		  <h2> About The e-Holocron for Computing </h2>
		

		<p><b>The e-Holocron for Computing Students is a BSCS-Student-A87113 initiative of the Uganda Christian University Department of Computing and Technology, under Mr.Simon Lubambo.This initiative came into existence as a consequence of computing students, more especially those in their first year, not being able to easily access scholastic materials on the Web essential for their success in the udergrad computing course. We help solve this predicament by connecting them to the various book repositories available on the internet (Online libraries).</p>
		<p>It is imperative to mention that the z-library for Africa is the <i>oil</i> for the continued running and sustainability of The e-Holocron computing repository.</b></p>
